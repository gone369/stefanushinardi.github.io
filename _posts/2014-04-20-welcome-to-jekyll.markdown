In the summer of 2016, I interned at Yahoo! (now Oath:) in cloud service team. I specifically worked on a distributed pub-sub service, Pulsar. The project is now open-sourced and was recently accepted to apache-incubator.

I did not quite have a specific summer project as I was treated as a full-time employee , but one of the significant was to build Websocket proxy for Pulsar.
