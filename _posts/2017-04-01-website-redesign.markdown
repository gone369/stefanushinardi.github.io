I finally had a chance to start a long-overdue personal website/blog/portfolio redesign. Since I became recently interested in UI design, I want to put in a good effort to build a page that represents me. Using this post, I hope that I could to justify a few of my design decisions. It's not going to be perfect, of course. But I guess I will use this opportunity to improve my skills.
